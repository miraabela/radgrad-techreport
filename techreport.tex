	\subsection{Priority of Opportunities}
	When looking for events and opportunities, a student should be aware of the most urgent opportunity first, which is one with a close deadline or an event that only happens once. This allows them to efficiently make use of their time when searching and applying for opportunities. This prevents them from spending time combing through huge lists while the deadline of a opportunity of big importance to them passes, because they don't see it in time. 
	
	Currently, in the ICS Department, we are made aware of upcoming events usually through our department advisor's emails,  the Discord group, or with flyers. Our current advisor is retiring soon, and he won't be forwarding all the valuable emails and events anymore. Also, sometimes important announcements may get lost in the sea of emails we receive. Additionally, some email forwards that go to the whole ICS Undergraduate mailing list are not applicable to everyone. 
	
	In the current RadGrad system, the Explorer doesn't indicate which opportunities are currently open for applications and doesn't show the deadlines. 
	
	
	Solution: RadGrad users fill out profile. Save the future advisor time. Have them forward emails directly to RadGrad, which we will handle and post in a central system for students to search through. This allows them to see everything upcoming in one place, instead of searching through emails. Only relevant announcements will be prioritized
	
	\subsection{Scholarships}
	
	Many scholarship sites have lists but they are unstructured and take very long to read through. As a student, I just want to know a few key things about the scholarship to decide whether or not to invest time to apply. Most websites only highlight the title, amount, and a paragraph of the description. Details such as deadlines, demographic requirements (age, gender, veteran, disabled, legacy, race, location, etc), application requirements (transcripts, essays, letters of recommendation, etc) are not easily highlighted. Reading through every single scholarship description website is very time consuming, and I only am searching for a few details.
